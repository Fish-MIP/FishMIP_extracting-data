# Accessing and plotting data from the ISIMIP Repository
These collection of notebooks include a step by step guide on how to access data directly from the [Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) Repository](https://data.isimip.org/) using the [`isimip-client`](https://github.com/ISI-MIP/isimip-client) library developed in Python by ISIMIP. These notebooks use the `reticulate` package to use the Python scripts directly in the R notebook.  

Notebooks showing examples on how to create simple maps making use of the `raster` and `ggplot2` packages are included in this repository.
