## R-based code
You are now ready to load the dataset into `R` to make any calculations and visualise results.

### Inspecting contents of netcdf file
For a quick overview of the content of the dataset we just downloaded, we can make use of the `metR` package.

```{r}
#Provide file path to netcdf that was recently downloaded.
data_file <- "../data/ecoocean_gfdl-esm4_nobasd_historical_histsoc_default_tc_lat-90.0to-40.0lon-180.0to180.0_monthly_1950_2014.nc"

#Check contents of netcdf
GlanceNetCDF(data_file)
```

This output, however, does not give you information about `No Data Values`. So we will load the first timestep included in our dataset to obtain this information.  
  
We will also plot the data to inspect it quickly.

```{r}
#Loading the first timestep as raster
tc_raster <- raster(data_file, band = 1)

#Extracting missing values
NA_val <- tc_raster@file@nodatavalue

#Plotting raster
plot(tc_raster)
```
We can see that a `No Data Values` is included in the dataset to mark areas where no values have been collected because all land areas have the same value.  
  
We can create a mask for the `No Data Values` and plot the raster again.

```{r}
#Changing values larger than No Data Value to NA
tc_raster[tc_raster >= NA_val] <- NA

#Plotting result
plot(tc_raster)
```

### Loading dataset as dataframe for easy manipulation
This data type allows us to use the `tidyverse` to make calculations easily.  
  
As seen from plotting the raster above, we must first mask `No Data Values` before we carry out any calculations.

```{r}
#Loading dataset as data frame
tc_SO <- ReadNetCDF(data_file, vars = "tc") %>% 
  #Masking No Data Values
  mutate(tc = case_when(tc >= NA_val ~ NA_real_,
         T ~ tc))
```

### Calculating climatology
We will use all data between 1960 and 2020 to calculate the climatological mean of total catch for the Southern Ocean.

```{r}
clim_tc <- tc_SO %>% 
  #Extracting data between 1960 and 2020
  filter(year(time) >= 1960 & year(time) <= 2020) %>% 
  #Calculating climatological mean for total catch per pixel
  group_by(lat, lon) %>% 
  summarise(mean_tc = mean(tc, na.rm = F))
```

### Plotting climatology

```{r}
#Accessing coastline shapefiles
land <- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(returnclass = "sf") %>% 
  #Extracting land within data boundaries
  st_crop(c(ymin = -90, ymax = -40, 
            xmin = -180, xmax = 180)) 

#Plotting data
clim_tc %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = lat, x = lon))+
  geom_contour_fill(aes(z = mean_tc, fill = stat(level)),
                        binwidth = 2)+
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrBr", 
                       direction = 1, 
                       super = ScaleDiscretised)+
  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(title.position = "top",
                               title.hjust =  0.5,
                               barwidth = 15))+
  geom_sf(data = land, inherit.aes = F,
          fill = "grey", color = "black")+
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, 
       fill = "Total Catch in g m-2")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom")
 

```


### Obtaining timeseries


```{r}
# tc_SO %>% 
#   #Calculating climatological mean for total catch per pixel
#   group_by(time) %>% 
#   summarise(mean_tc = mean(tc, na.rm = F)) %>% View()
#   ggplot() %>% 
  


  
```
